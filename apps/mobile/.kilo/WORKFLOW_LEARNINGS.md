### iOS 26.5 scheme-confirmation prompt wording breaks login.sh on a fresh install

- Symptom: on a freshly installed dev client, `apps/mobile/e2e/login.sh` fails its settle assertion with the simulator stuck on the home screen under a SpringBoard dialog `Open in "Kilo"?` (Cancel/Open).
- Cause: iOS 26.5 reworded the custom-scheme confirmation from `Open this page in "Kilo"?` to `Open in "Kilo"?`. The matchers in `e2e/flows/open-app.yaml` and `e2e/flows/settle-app.yaml` only know the old text, so the bounded optional-prompt tap never fires. The dialog appears exactly once per install (first external open of the `exp+kilo-app` scheme); iOS does not re-prompt afterwards.
- Fix: tap `Open` once yourself (a two-line temp Maestro flow with `appId: host.springboard` and `tapOn: { text: 'Open', optional: true }`, or any equivalent), then re-run `login.sh` — it is idempotent and completes. Do not reinstall afterwards: a reinstall re-arms the one-time prompt. If the flows are ever updated, add `Open in "Kilo"\?` as an alternative in the same regexes rather than replacing the old text, so older iOS versions keep working.
